# Project 3, Milestone 3 Implementation Plan

Use this document to plan the changes you need to make to your Project 3 code to implement file uploads for your media catalog.

## File Upload - Types of Files
> What types of files will you allow users to upload?
> Can users upload any type of file? Can user only upload one type of file?
> Or can users upload several different types of files?
> List the file extensions of the types of files your users may upload.

- TODO: file type
- ...


## File Upload - Updated DB Schema
> Plan any updates you need to make to your database schema to support file uploads.
>
> 1. Copy your Project 3 DB Schema for the _entries_ table here.
> 2. Modify the schema to include any file upload information you desire to store in your database.
>    If you don't need to modify anything, explain why.

TODO: entries table name

```
TODO: updated _entries_ schema
```


## File Upload - File Storage
> Plan the file path to store the uploaded files on the server's file system.
> Store the uploaded files in a subfolder of the `public/uploads` folder using the entries table name as the subfolder name.

TODO: file path to store uploaded media files for entries



## File Upload - Path and URL
> Assume that a user completed the insert/edit entry form.
> The **id** for the new record is **154**.
>
> 1. Plan the file system path to store the uploaded file.
> 2. Plan the URL to load the uploaded file in your website's HTML.

**File System Storage Path:**

```
TODO: file path
```

**Resource URL:**

```
<picture>
  <img src="TODO: uploaded file URL">
</picture>
```


## File Upload - Form Input
> Write the HTML of an `<input>` element that allows users to upload a file.

```html
TODO: file input element
```


## File Upload - PHP File Upload Data
> Use the `name` attribute of the file input you planned above to plan how you will
> access the uploaded file data in PHP using the `$_FILES` superglobal.

> Write the PHP code to access the uploaded file data from the `$_FILES` superglobal.
> Only include the data you will extract from the `$_FILES` superglobal. For example, the file name.
> Hint: <https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.file-upload.post-method.php>

```
$_FILES[TODO: file parameter name][TODO: file data]
```


## Filtering by a Tag - Query String Parameters
> Plan the query string for filtering by a tag for the "view all" pages.
> (This plan should be exactly the same for both the consumer and admin views.)
> Include the query string parameter and its value.
> Document the value with the field from your database in all CAPITOL letters.

Example: `?category=ID` where `ID` is the `id` field from the `categories` table.

TODO: query string for filtering by a tag


## Filtering by a Tag - SQL Query Plan
> Plan the SQL query to retrieve all entries with a specific tag using the query string parameter.

```
TODO: SQL query to get all entries with a specific tag
```
